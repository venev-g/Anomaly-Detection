# üéâ DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE FIXES COMPLETE

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. MLflow Model Not Logged Error
**Problem**: "MLflow model with name model was not logged in the current pipeline run"
**Solution**: 
- Added MLflow experiment tracker decorators to model building steps
- Implemented proper MLflow logging in `model_builder.py` with `mlflow.xgboost.log_model()`
- Added model registration and signature inference

**Files Modified**:
- `src/model_builder.py` - Added MLflow imports and logging calls
- `steps/model_building_step.py` - Added `@step(experiment_tracker="mlflow_tracker")` decorators

### ‚úÖ 2. Matplotlib Figure Materializer Warning
**Problem**: "No materializer is registered for type matplotlib.figure.Figure"
**Solution**: 
- Modified model evaluator to save plots as PNG files instead of returning Figure objects
- Added proper file cleanup with `plt.close()`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/model_evaluator.py` - Changed to save plots as files instead of Figure objects

### ‚úÖ 3. MLflow Prediction Service Not Found Error
**Problem**: "No MLflow prediction service found for pipeline 'continuous_deployment_pipeline'"
**Solution**: 
- Fixed service status checking by replacing `service.get_status()` with `service.is_running`
- Corrected MLFlowDeploymentService API usage

**Files Modified**:
- `steps/prediction_service_loader.py` - Fixed service status checking
- `run_deployment.py` - Fixed final status display
- `manual_deploy.py` - Fixed service status logging

### ‚úÖ 4. Predictor Step 400 Bad Request Error
**Problem**: MLflow serving endpoint was receiving data in wrong format
**Root Cause**: Model expected 122 one-hot encoded features in alphabetical order, but was receiving only 41 features in pandas concat order
**Solution**: 
- Created feature expansion function to map input data to complete MLflow feature set
- Implemented direct HTTP requests with proper `dataframe_split` format
- Added comprehensive feature mapping for all categorical variables

**Files Modified**:
- `steps/predictor.py` - Complete rewrite with proper feature expansion and HTTP requests

## üß™ Testing Results

All deployment pipeline errors have been resolved:

1. **‚úÖ MLflow Integration**: Models are now properly logged with experiment tracking
2. **‚úÖ Matplotlib Handling**: Plots are saved as PNG files without materializer warnings  
3. **‚úÖ Service Deployment**: MLflow prediction services deploy successfully
4. **‚úÖ Predictions**: HTTP requests to MLflow endpoint work with proper data format
5. **‚úÖ End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete deployment pipeline runs without errors

## üöÄ Deployment Status

The ZenML anomaly detection deployment pipeline is now fully functional:

- **Model Training**: XGBoost models train with GPU acceleration
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow tracks all experiments and model artifacts  
- **Model Deployment**: MLflow serves models on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/invocations`
- **Batch Inference**: Predictor step makes successful predictions on test data
- **Service Management**: Services can be started, stopped, and monitored

## üîß Key Technical Details

### Feature Engineering
- **Original Features**: 41 after preprocessing (numeric + basic one-hot encoding)
- **MLflow Expected**: 122 features (complete categorical expansion in alphabetical order)
- **Solution**: Dynamic feature expansion in predictor step

### Data Format
- **MLflow Endpoint Format**: `{"dataframe_split": {"columns": [...], "data": [...]}}`
- **Feature Order**: Alphabetical ordering of all possible categorical combinations
- **Data Types**: Proper integer/float type handling for MLflow schema validation

### Model Architecture  
- **Binary Classification**: Anomaly detection (normal vs. anomaly)
- **Training Data**: KDD99 network intrusion detection dataset
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated XGBoost with CUDA support

## üìù Verification Commands

To verify the deployment is working:

```bash
# Test the deployed model
python test_deployment_final.py

# Check service status  
zenml model-deployer models list

# View experiment tracking
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri 'file:/path/to/mlruns'

# Run full deployment pipeline
python run_deployment.py
```

All three original deployment pipeline errors have been successfully resolved! üéâ
